			<hr></hr>
			<p>Itâ€™s snowing outside, thick fluffy flakes from the sky only visible in the cone of streetlamps. I close my phone and hang up the call. 
                They would be arriving soon, perhaps a bit delayed by the weather. I had only landed at the airport a few moments ago. Itâ€™s almost Christmas, and the 
                atmosphere is ripe with anticipation. The airport is packed, Silver Bells plays faintly, barely audible over the hum of activity. I step onto the tram to go 
                to the other side of the airport towards the pickup area to retrieve my suitcase and wait for them to arrive. I could see the snow outside like TV static as we 
                sped through the dark. I think about seeing family, about the warm, comfortable feeling of a home on Christmas; when the ground was covered in snow, and the sky 
                was dark, but the inside of the house was content and bright. The tram stops, and I get off to collect my suitcase. I take a seat next to a window, I can feel the 
                cold radiate from it and see my reflection fog in my breath. The music has switched to a jazz rendition of Christmastime is Here. Theyâ€˜ll be here soon, I feel my 
                eyelids start to close, I think Iâ€™ll just sleep for a few minutes.<hr></hr>
